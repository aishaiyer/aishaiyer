# Hi, I’m Aishwarya Iyer 👋

**Computational Scientist → Machine Learning & Data Science**

PhD-trained computational scientist with a decade of experience building 
physics-based models, Bayesian inference pipelines, and uncertainty-aware 
data analysis workflows. I specialize in extracting robust insights from 
complex, noisy datasets and translating models into decision-relevant results.

I’m currently expanding my applied ML skillset through focused projects in:

- Deep Learning (PyTorch)
- Computer Vision (CNNs)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Interpretable & Robust ML
- Uncertainty-aware modeling

## 🔬 Background

My research career focused on:

• Scientific modeling & simulation  
• Bayesian / probabilistic inference  
• High-dimensional parameter estimation  
• Uncertainty quantification  
• Working with high-noise real-world data  

This foundation naturally extends to modern ML and AI systems.
